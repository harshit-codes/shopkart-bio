# Code Patterns

This directory documents common code patterns used in ShopKart.bio to maintain consistency and best practices.

## Purpose

- Establish consistent coding patterns across the codebase
- Document reusable solutions to common problems
- Reduce duplication of code and effort
- Provide guidance for new contributors

## Contributing

When identifying a new pattern:

1. Document the pattern with clear examples
2. Explain the problem it solves
3. Highlight any edge cases or limitations
4. Include TypeScript interfaces where applicable

As the project evolves, this documentation will be updated to reflect the established code patterns and best practices.
