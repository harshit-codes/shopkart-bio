# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains records of architectural decisions made during the development of ShopKart.bio.

## What are ADRs?

ADRs (Architecture Decision Records) are documents that capture important architectural decisions made along with their context and consequences. They serve as a historical record for the project and help new team members understand why certain architectural choices were made.

## ADR Structure

Each ADR follows this structure:

1. **Title**: A descriptive title for the decision
2. **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Rejected, Deprecated, or Superseded
3. **Context**: The factors that influenced the decision
4. **Decision**: The actual architectural decision that was made
5. **Consequences**: The results of the decision, both positive and negative
6. **Alternatives**: Other options that were considered (if applicable)

## Current ADRs

No architectural decisions have been formally recorded yet. As decisions are made, they will be added here.

## Creating a New ADR

To create a new ADR, copy the template file `adr-template.md` and rename it to `NNNN-title.md` where `NNNN` is the next number in sequence and `title` is a short hyphenated title.
