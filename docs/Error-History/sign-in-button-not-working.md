# Sign-in Button Not Working Issue

## Issue Description
The sign-in button on the login page was not responding when clicked, preventing users from logging in to the application.

## Root Cause Analysis
After investigation, multiple issues were identified:

1. **Form Submission Conflict**: There was a conflict between the form's `onSubmit` handler and the button's `onClick` handler. The button had an additional onClick handler that was calling the same handleSubmit function that was already being triggered by the form's onSubmit.

2. **Complex Authentication Flow**: The authentication flow in the AuthContext was overly complex with multiple nested try/catch blocks and multiple authentication checks, which made error handling difficult.

3. **Session Management Issues**: The session management in the signInAccount function wasn't properly handling scenarios where session creation might fail or when switching between users.

## Solution Implemented
The following changes were made to address the issue:

1. **Form Submission Cleanup**:
   - Removed the redundant onClick handler from the sign-in button
   - Enhanced the handleSubmit function with better error handling and logging

2. **Authentication Flow Improvement**:
   - Simplified the signIn function in AuthContext
   - Added better error handling and more detailed logging
   - Improved user profile creation flow

3. **Session Management Enhancement**:
   - Improved session handling in signInAccount function
   - Added better error handling for different authentication scenarios
   - Enhanced logging for debugging purposes

## Preventive Measures
To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. **Code Simplification**: Keep authentication flows as simple as possible for better maintainability.
2. **Consistent Event Handling**: Use either form onSubmit OR button onClick, but not both simultaneously.
3. **Enhanced Logging**: Added more detailed logging to make troubleshooting easier.
4. **Error Handling**: Improved error handling at all levels of the authentication process.
5. **Testing Protocol**: Implement comprehensive testing for all authentication flows.

## Related Areas
This fix might impact:
- User registration process
- Session management
- Authentication state management
- Route protection middleware

## Testing Recommendations
To validate the fix:
1. Test login with valid credentials
2. Test login with invalid credentials
3. Test login when rate limited
4. Test login flow when already authenticated
5. Test session persistence across page refreshes
